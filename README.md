# TSP_optimization

## Overview
This repository provides a Python notebook with a class for solving Traveling Salesman Problems (TSP) using Pyomo and the CPLEX solver. The implemented class handles multiple TSP instances, and in the case where there is only one driver, it efficiently solves a simple TSP problem.

## Requirements
- Pyomo
- IBM CPLEX solver
- Python 3.x

## Usage
1. Install the required dependencies.
    ```bash
    pip install pyomo
    # Ensure you have IBM CPLEX installed on your laptop
    ```
2. Open the notebook and run the cells to see the TSP problem-solving in action.
3. Customize the class and parameters based on your specific TSP scenarios.
